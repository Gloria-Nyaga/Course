    <p align="justified"><big> Akirachix has been an amazing experience so far. I love the environment since it is beautiful, peaceful, clean and really accomodative.
        <br tags> The meals are delicious, the sleeping areas are really comfortable and the students are friendly and ready to help where needed. 
        I love <br tag> how we are a diverse community and despite that no one treats the other differently. Moreover, it consists of an amazing team that run <br tags> the program from 
        the staff that maintain the school, to the alumnus, teachng assistants, educators and the administators who are ready <br tag>to guide and help us whenever needed.
